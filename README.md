# Steps to Run the App
## Install dependencies: 
Ensure all required dependencies are installed by running:

`npm install`

This should be done in the root folder of your project.

## Run the JSON server: 
To launch the JSON server with the local data stored in db.json, use the following command:

`json-server --watch db.json`

This should be done in the root folder of your project.
This will start a local server with the mock API data from db.json.

## Run the Angular app: 
To launch the Angular app, run:

`ng serve`

The app will compile and should be accessible at http://localhost:4200/.
This should be done in the root folder of your project.

## Additional notes:

Make sure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed globally on your machine.
The Angular app is an Angular 2+ application, and it's assumed you have Angular CLI installed to use commands like ng serve.
